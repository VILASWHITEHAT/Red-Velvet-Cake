First, you always want to preheat your oven to 350 degrees. While the oven is preheating you can go ahead and start baking the cake. You would want to add your cake mix into the bowl and add the eggs. Then add in the water and vegtable oil and mix. When mixing use any mixer hand held one or electric if using electric first keep the mixer on low speed so cake mix wont go flying everywhere. Get out a baking pan and add butter and rub the pan on the inside with it. Add the batter into the pan and place the pan gently on the oven and close the oven door. Bake the cake for 20 to 25 minutes for darker pans and 25 to 30 minutes for lighter colored pans. Pro tip is when you feel ike the cake is done take a clean toothpick and place into the cake and if the toothpick comes out clean your cake is done if it comes out with liquid your cake still needs to bake. Once the cake finishs baking place the pan outside on a heat proof mat so no burning ocurs. Let the cake rest for 10 minutes to still have a somewhat warm inside and if you dont like warm cake wait for 15 to 20 minutes. If you want to frost the cake wait for 20 minutes for the cake to cool down then place the frosting. This helps with the frosting to not melt. One everything is like how you want it take a slice and enjoy.
